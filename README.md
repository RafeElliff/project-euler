Solutions are not necessarily in order, as there were some I simply didn't know how to do at the time so i chose to do them at a later date, therefore the order I solved the problems (and therefore the commits), are not always in the same order as the problems on the website
Any other (non main.py) python files in the repository are usually scraps of working from problems that I skipped and wanted to come back to later, so that I didn't lose the workings
